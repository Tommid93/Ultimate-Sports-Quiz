### The Ultimate Sports Quiz

## Introduction
Before I explain my project I wanted to point out that I had already completed 6 months of learning on Javascript before being this course. The interest I had in this is what inspired me to want to take this further. I bring this up as I feel that my coding for this project is a little bit more advanced than a beginner. I came into this project with some good knowledge compared to other types of coding such as Python to which I have no knowledge. 

I used one of the ideas in the assessment criteria for this project which was to design a quiz game. I felt that there were plenty of features that I could implement that would demonstrate my knowledge of javascript but that would still test me. I wanted the quiz game to be challenging but fun at the same time.

# Target Audience
As the name of my project suggests, my target audience for this project is passionate or knowledgable sports fans who wanted to test their knowledge. Originally I was going to complete a general knowledge test, however I decided I wanted to have a more defined target audience which would also help me to create a more specialised design for the project rather than being generic.
